# Unblockedgames website

## Description:
Another unblocked games website. Though this one looks like it was copied straight from tag-2, I hand coded the styles and files (I only took the games from other websites). I sometimes change the address and name to counter getting blocked by Cisco.

## Website features:
* Redirects to canvas after 200 seconds ðŸ•™
* (soon to be public) Search tab ðŸ”Ž
* Fulscreen for games â‡±
* Favicon and title desgised as canvas dashboard ðŸ¤«

## Usage:
Just go to the current link and play whatever you want. If you want to fork, please give me some credit. I worked hard on this.

## Contributing:
I would be very greatful if someone took the time to help me with this project. I've been working on this for WAY too long by myself.
